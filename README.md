# FrontEndProjects
Projects utilizing HTML CSS or/and JavaScript
Purpose: In VsCode, I created a model landing page replicating typical web pages one sees on the internet. My goal with this project is to showcase what I have learned in HTML and CSS as I progress as a developer.

Languages and tools: The languages and tools I used were strictly HTML and CSS. I used the flex-box model to help me better construct an effective web page that is also readable and visually pleasing.
